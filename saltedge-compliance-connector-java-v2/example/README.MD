# Salt Edge Compliance Connector Java Example

This codebase is a full-stack application built on Spring Boot Framework.  
Is designated to demonstrate (simulate) communication between ASPSP/Bank and TPP/Client.  
_This application is just a Proof Of Concept._      
  
## Application Requirements
  
1. JDK, at least version 8 
1. Spring Boot Framework, at least version 2.2.+
1. Registration & API Keys  
   Follow the guide on how to [register and add API keys](https://priora.saltedge.com/docs/aspsp/v1#registrationandapikeys)
  
## Example Application Quick Setup

#### 1. Clone the project.

#### 2. Navigate to project's root folder:  
```bash
cd saltedge-compliance-connector-java
```

#### 3. Create configuration files:
```bash
cp example/src/main/resources/application.example.yml example/src/main/resources/application.yml
cp example/src/main/resources/application.example.properties example/src/main/resources/application.properties
```

#### 4. Add secret keys:
**SDK expects private key in PKCS#8 format**  
You can generate your RSA key pair using this commands: 
```bash
openssl genpkey -out connector_private_prod.pem -algorithm RSA -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
openssl rsa -pubout -in connector_private_prod.pem -out connector_public_prod.pem
```  
Add the content of Public Key (`connector_public_prod.pem)` in Provider's [Environment](https://priora.saltedge.com/providers/).     
Save your private key generated by openssl in `/resources` folder of application.  
  
#### 5. Edit configuration files:  
* Example application uses a `H2 in memory` database (for now), can be changed easily in the `application.properties` for any other database type.
* Set your external host name in `application.properties`
```yaml
app.url=https://my_host.org
```
